#Campus Eats
Campus Eats is a food delivery service designed to allow George Mason University students and faculty to hire other students to pick up food from restaurants around campus and deliver it to them.
#How do I use it?
In order to sign up, a user must have a GMU net ID. A user simply enters their ID and a password and then verifies the account based on a code sent to their GMU email. After that, they're able to post their own orders as well as act as couriers for other users on the site.
#How does it work?
Campus Eats works through a web app. The front end of the website was made using Bootstrap 3.7.7 CDN and the user accounts are handled using AWS Cognito through the userAuth.js file. Orders are stored in a database hosted by AWS and accessed through PHP scripts.
#Why did you make it?
Though there are other food delivery options for campus, none of them are done entirely by GMU students/faculty. This means that the couriers will know how to get around campus, and will be able to make deliveries quickly as they'll never be more than about a 15 minute walk away from their destination. Also, this was the only idea of ours that got approved for our CS321 project so we have to make it or else we'll fail.
